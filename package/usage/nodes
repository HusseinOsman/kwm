List all nodes of a given type which are present in your environment.

Usage:
  kwm nodes [all etcd controlplane worker]

Note:
  This can be used in conjunction with xargs to perform actions on multiple
  nodes at once. For example, this will generate a script to bootstrap all
  etcd nodes:

    kwm nodes etcd | xargs -n 1 kwm script etcd-node

  This would execute it immediately, 5 nodes at a time:

    kwm nodes etcd | xargs -n 1 -P 5 kwm script etcd-node | bash
