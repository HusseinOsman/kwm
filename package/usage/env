Display environment variables needed to generate a script or manifest.

Usage:
  kwm env [cluster-admin cni dns pki startup]
  kwm env [controlplane-node etcd-node worker-node] <node-key>

Examples:
  Use this command to familiarize yourself with what input is needed to
  generate scripts and manifests.

  When a node-key is specified, KWM looks for KWM_*_[node-key] environment
  variables and reassigns them to the same name without the node key. For
  example, KWM_ROLE_nodekey=test becomes KWM_ROLE=test for the duration of
  the command.

  This can be illustrated by the following commands:

    KWM_ROLE_node0=worker kwm env worker-node node0
    KWM_ROLE_node0=worker kwm env worker-node node1

  Note how the value in KWM_ROLE_test is collapsed into the value KWM_ROLE
  when there is a corresponding entry for KWM_ROLE_[node-key].
