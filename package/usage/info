Welcome to Kubernetes Without Magic!

This software aims to automate the creation and maintenance of Kubernetes
clusters by dynamically generating shell scripts based on simple configuration
expressed as environment variables. A familiarity with UNIX fundamentals (stdin,
stdout, pipelines and redirection) is recommended to fully utilize this tool.

Though a cluster can be created with a single command, new operators are
encouraged to examine and execute each step individually until the overall
process is understood.

Care has been taken to avoid assumptions about the underlying infrastructure.
This tool should work equally well for target environments in the cloud, on
premises, using VMs or bare metal machines. This is an intentional design
decision meant to eliminate reliance on vendor-specific functionality.

Said differently:

"Prepare a set of machines capable of running Kubernetes that can be reached
 over a network--a cluster should be able to run on them in a matter of minutes.
 From the perspective of correct operation who owns the hardware should be
 irrelevant."
