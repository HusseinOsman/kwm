KWM_ETCD_NAMES
  The hostnames of your etcd members. The bootstrap script ensures these are
  actually set and that the needed self-referential entries are present in
  /etc/hosts (this may be redundant for some environments). Used by etcd for
  pre-defining each cluster member during bootstrapping.
