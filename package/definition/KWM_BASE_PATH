KWM_BASE_PATH
  When used for commands run locally this is a relative path to the folder where
  pem files will be generated. For example:

    KWM_ETCD_CLIENT_SUBJECT_ALTNAMES="IP:10.100.0.5,DNS:aws-etcd-0" \\
    KWM_BASE_PATH=pki \\
    KWM_CLUSTER_NAME=example \\
    kwm compile pki

  When used for commands run remotely, this is the path where shared PKI files
  will be copied / sourced.
