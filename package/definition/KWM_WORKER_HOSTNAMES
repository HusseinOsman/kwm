KWM_WORKER_HOSTNAMES
  The hostnames of your worker nodes. The bootstrap script ensures these are
  actually set and that the needed self-referential entries are present in
  /etc/hosts (this may be redundant for some environments).
  Used in TLS certificate as subjectAltName and organization name to facilitate
  secure registration with the cluster.
