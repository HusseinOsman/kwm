A command to connect to your Node.

Examples:
  # If your Node is directly reachable by the machine running kwm.
  ssh root@55.55.55.55

  # If your Node must be accessed through a bastion host.
  ssh -A -t root@44.44.44.44 ssh -A root@55.55.55.55

  # If you don't care about trust-on-first-use.
  ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@55.55.55.55

Note:
  Be sure to quote this environment variable or things will get strange fast.

  KWM_CONNECT="ssh root@55.55.55.55"
