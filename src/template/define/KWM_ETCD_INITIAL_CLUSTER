Supplied as the "--initial-cluster" value to etcd for bootstrapping the cluster.

If not specified explicitly, this is "magically" produced by kwm using all hosts
in the environment with a role of etcd.

For example, given the following hosts in the environment:

KWM_ROLE_node0=etcd
KWM_HOSTNAME_node0=etcd0
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node0=10.100.0.5
...
KWM_ROLE_node1=etcd
KWM_HOSTNAME_node1=etcd1
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node1=10.100.1.5
...
KWM_ROLE_node2=etcd
KWM_HOSTNAME_node2=etcd2
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node0=10.100.2.5

...the resultant value would be:
KWM_ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER=aws-etcd-0=https://10.100.0.5:2380,aws-etcd-1=https://10.100.1.5:2380,aws-etcd-2=https://10.100.2.5:2380

Examples:
  # Inspect this value by looking at the etcd node installation script.
  kwm render etcd-node <nodeKey>
