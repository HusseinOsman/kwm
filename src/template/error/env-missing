Sorry, cannot render ${resource} yet.

Please provide values for these variables:

$(sed 's/^/  /' <<<"${missing:-None}")

Note:
  Run "kwm env ${resource}" to see all required variables and their current values.
  Run "kwm define <variable>" for more information about the listed variables.
  Run "kwm render ${resource} --ignore-missing-env" to render anyway.
