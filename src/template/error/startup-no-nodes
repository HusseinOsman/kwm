Almost there! If you want to use the startup script to bootstrap a cluster with
a single command, you'll need to include configuration for at least one node in
each role (etcd, controlplane and worker).

If you're testing this for the first time, try defining a single node that
performs all roles. That's not a good plan for production, but it is great
for getting things running quickly to play around.

Here's some boilerplate to get you started:

export KWM_ROLE_now=etcd controlplane worker
export KWM_HOSTNAME_now=tiny
export KWM_PRIVATE_IP_now=[your-private-ip]
export KWM_CONNECT_now="ssh [your-sudo-capable-user]@[your-ssh-accessible-ip]"

Note:
  Run "kwm define <variable>" for more information about the listed variables.
