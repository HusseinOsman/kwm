Heads up, if you haven't run "kwm help" at least once, consider doing that now.

Almost there! If you want to use the startup script to install Kubernetes with
a single command, you'll need to include configuration for at least one node in
each role (etcd, controlplane and worker).

If you're testing this for the first time, try defining a single node that
performs all roles. That's not a good plan for production, but it is great
for getting things running quickly to play around.

Here's some boilerplate to get you started:

export KWM_ROLE_now="etcd controlplane worker"
export KWM_HOSTNAME_now=tiny
export KWM_PRIVATE_IP_now=[your-private-ip]
export KWM_CONNECT_now="ssh [your-sudo-capable-user]@[your-ssh-accessible-ip]"
export KWM_CLUSTER_NAME=kwm
export KWM_APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP=[public-ip-of-only-node]
export KWM_APISERVER_PRIVATE_IP=[private-ip-of-only-node]

Once everything is defined, "kwm startup" will output a bash script that will
bootstrap your cluster. After inspecting it, you can run it thusly:

  kwm startup | bash

Good luck!

Notes:
  Run "kwm define <variable>" for more information about the listed variables.
