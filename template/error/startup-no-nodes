Heads up, if you haven't run "kwm help" at least once, consider doing that now.

Almost there! If you want to use the startup script to install Kubernetes with
a single command, you'll need to include configuration for at least one node in
each role (etcd, controlplane and worker).

If you're testing this for the first time, try defining a single node that
performs all roles. That's not a good plan for production, but it is great
for getting things running quickly to play around.

Here's some boilerplate to get you started:

export KWM_CLUSTER_NAME=kwm
export KWM_APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP=[public-ip-of-only-node]
export KWM_APISERVER_PRIVATE_IP=[private-ip-of-only-node]

export KWM_ROLE_now="etcd controlplane worker"
export KWM_HOSTNAME_now=tiny
export KWM_PRIVATE_IP_now=[your-private-ip]
export KWM_CONNECT_now="ssh [your-sudo-capable-user]@[your-ssh-accessible-ip]"
^
KWM calls the "_now" portion of these variables a "node key". By using different
keys you can define multiple hosts for KWM to manage simultaneously. The value
of they keys is entirely up to you, they have no impact on your deployments.

To see which nodes are available for management, try running "kwm nodes".

Once you have everything defined, "kwm startup" will output a bash script that
will bootstrap your cluster. After inspecting it, you can run it thusly:

  $SCRIPT_NAME startup | bash

Good luck!

Note:
  Run "kwm define <variable>" for more information about the listed variables.
