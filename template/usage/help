Welcome to Kubernetes Without Magic!

This project aims to automate the creation and maintenance of production-quality
Kubernetes clusters in the most transparent way possible: using bash scripts you
can inspect before you run.

A familiarity with UNIX fundamentals and systems administration is recommended
to fully utilize this tool. If you're unsure you have the experience needed, try
running through a few workshops:

  $SCRIPT_NAME workshop

When you are ready, prepare an Ubuntu server that you can SSH to with root
access (using any means you wish) and run this:

  $SCRIPT_NAME startup

Unless you have already configured your environment, the first response will be
an error. Don't worry, that's expected.

Read on and you'll have a cluster running in no time.
