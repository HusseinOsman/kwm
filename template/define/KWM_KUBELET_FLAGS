Supply additional, arbitrary command line flags to the kubelet.

If not specified explicitly, this is "magically" produced so Nodes can have work
scheduled to them based on their role.

In this form, the affected Node will not allow Pods to be scheduled to unless
they "tolerate" the taint:

  KWM_ROLE_node0="controlplane"

  ...the resultant "magic" value would be:
  KWM_KUBELET_FLAGS="
    --node-labels="node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane=true"
    --register-with-taints="note-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane=true:NoSchedule
  "

In this form, the affected Node has two roles and is NOT tainted to disallow
scheduling:

  KWM_ROLE_node0="controlplane worker"

  ...the resultant "magic" value would be:
  KWM_KUBELET_FLAGS="
    --node-labels="node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane=true,node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=true"
    --register-with-taints="note-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane=true:NoSchedule
  "

Note:
  This should be removed as soon as it is possible to do this with environment
  variables or configuration manifests.
