Supplied as the "--etcd-servers" value to kube-apiserver.

If not specified explicitly, this is "magically" produced by using all hosts in
the environment with a role of etcd.

For example, given the following hosts in the environment:

KWM_ROLE_node0=etcd
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node0=10.100.0.5
...
KWM_ROLE_node1=etcd
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node1=10.100.1.5
...
KWM_ROLE_node2=etcd
KWM_PRIVATE_IP_node0=10.100.2.5

...the resultant value would be:
https://10.100.0.5:2379,https://10.100.1.5:2379,https://10.100.2.5:2379

Examples:
  # Inspect this value by looking at pki generation.
  $SCRIPT_NAME render pki

  # Inspect this value by reading the generated cert directly.
  openssl x509 -noout -text -in apiserver-to-etcd-cert.pem | grep DNS
